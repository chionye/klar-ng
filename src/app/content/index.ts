      'This facility is one of the most modern water production areas worldwide. Twenty-four boreholes are equipped with brand-new pumps, which extract clean and clear water from a depth of 150 meters. The installed capacity reaches 70,000m3 per day, and the water is transported to our main reservoir Gravity Market just by Gravity. The pumps are designed to run 24/7 based on a steady electricity supply. To guarantee this 24-hour gas power supply, operated by CNG, an independent 4 MW gas power plant was implemented. The total capacity of this water reservoir is estimated at around 200,000m3 per day.',
